## Our vision:

All digital patient data become biomarkers with the help of artificial intelligence. These digital biomarkers help to personalize therapy decisions. <!--more-->

## What does that mean?

Often there are multiple equivalent therapies for a patient. Personalized cancer therapy predicts which patients are more likely to respond to one of these specific therapies. Biomarkers, especially in cancer medicine, are used for this prediction. To date, few biomarkers are measured to individualize therapy decisions, and optional targeted therapy is usually initiated based on these biomarkers.

For example, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a biomarker that can be used to target esophageal cancer. HER2, a member of the EGFR family, is localized on the cell membrane and accelerates tumor growth. As a biomarker, the HER2 status determines the potential administration of trastuzumab therapy. If the HER2 status is positive, therapy is recommended for the antibody trastuzumab in palliative esophageal cancer.

## How does it work?

The more biomarkers used, the more treatment decisions can be individualized. The idea of the Computational Surgical Oncology group is to digitize all available patient data and use them as biomarkers for individual therapy decisions. With the help of neural networks, the resulting complex and extensive data can be mastered and transformed into personal therapy decisions. 

Of particular interest are pathological image data, such as morphological H&E staining, which contain more information than is visible to the bare eye. Thus, it has been possible to predict molecular mutations based on H&E data.

The Computational Surgical Oncology group uses digital H&E staining (about 10 Gb per image) to predict the response to cancer therapies. In the future, this will allow individualized decisions as to whether a patient should have upfront surgery or neoadjuvant therapy.

The type and number of biomarkers will be gradually increased for the personalization of cancer therapy. Clinical data will be combined with H&E stainings to optimize the prediction of response to therapy. Later, radiological imaging such as computed tomography (CT) will also be integrated as biomarkers. In addition to choosing the optimal individual therapy, artificial intelligence can be used to determine the prognosis for cancer.

Digital biomarkers support important surgical decisions during operations. In addition to cancer therapy, the focus of the Computational Surgical Oncology group is on AI-supported optimization of surgical strategy. Biomarkers can, for example, help in planning surgery to select the most suitable surgical procedure for an individual patient. Artificial intelligence methods also assess the surgical risk on an individual basis.
