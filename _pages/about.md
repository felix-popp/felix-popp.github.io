The Computational Surgical Oncology (CSO) group conducts translational research in artificial intelligence and data science.

Core competence is computer vision, using high-resolution images as input for neural networks. We use deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

We do projects in oncological surgery, oncology, and surgery. This approach advances personalized medicine, especially personalized cancer therapy.
